# PIC18F8722 Guitar Hero Game

This repository contains a simple guitar hero game project for PIC18F8722 microcontroller written in C. The game simulates a guitar hero game using buttons as inputs and LEDs as outputs. 

## Features

- The game simulates a guitar hero game using buttons as inputs and LEDs as outputs.
- The game uses the PIC18F8722 microcontroller and a character LCD display.
- The game has multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- The game keeps track of the score and displays it on the LCD.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the project in MPLAB X IDE and build the project.
3. Connect the PIC18F8722 microcontroller to the computer using a programmer (e.g. PICkit, ICD3).
4. Program the microcontroller with the built hex file.
5. Connect the microcontroller to the LEDs and buttons as per the connections specified in the code.
6. Power on the system and use the buttons to play the game.
