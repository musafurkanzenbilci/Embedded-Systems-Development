# PIC18F8722 Custom Text Editor

This repository contains a custom text editor project for PIC18F8722 microcontroller written in C. The text editor allows you to write with built-in characters as well as custom characters that you can create.

## Features

- Text editing capabilities including inserting, deleting and editing characters.
- Ability to create and use custom characters on the LCD display.
- Menu-driven user interface for easy navigation and operation.
- Uses the PIC18F8722 microcontroller and a character LCD display.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the project in MPLAB X IDE and build the project.
3. Connect the PIC18F8722 microcontroller to the computer using a programmer (e.g. PICkit, ICD3).
4. Program the microcontroller with the built hex file.
5. Connect the microcontroller to an LCD display as per the connections specified in the code.
6. Power on the system and use the menu-driven user interface to navigate and use the text editor.
