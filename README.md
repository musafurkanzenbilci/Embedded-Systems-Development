# Embedded Systems Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects related to logic design and embedded systems development. The logic design projects are in .circ and Verilog files, and the embedded systems projects are written in assembly (.s) and C for PIC18F8722 microcontroller.

## Logic Design Projects

1. **Digital Clock**: A digital clock design in .circ file format, implemented using basic logic gates and flip-flops.
2. **Traffic Light Controller**: A traffic light controller design in Verilog, simulating the behavior of a traffic light system.

## Embedded Systems Projects

1. **Countdown Timer**: A simple assembly program for PIC18F8722 microcontroller that blinks an LED at a specific interval for a game.
2. **GuitarHero**: A C program for PIC18F8722 microcontroller that displays a game on an LCD screen.
3. **Custom Text Editor**: A C program for PIC18F8722 microcontroller that you can create sentences created with built-in characters and user-created custom characters and displays it on an LCD screen.

## Getting Started

To run the projects, you need to have the following tools and libraries installed on your computer:

- Xilinx ISE or any other logic design tool (if you want to run the logic design projects)
- MPLAB X IDE or any other embedded systems development tool (if you want to run the embedded systems projects)
- A PIC microcontroller programmer (e.g. PICkit, ICD3)
- Any other dependencies or libraries that are specific to a project (these will be listed in the project's readme)

To run a project, simply navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the project's readme.
