# Traffic Light Simulator

This repository contains a traffic light simulator implemented in Verilog as a logic design project. The simulation models the behavior of a traffic light system and can be used to test and evaluate different traffic light control algorithms.

## Features

- The simulation models the behavior of a traffic light system with three traffic lights (red, yellow, green) for two directions of traffic.
- The simulation includes input signals for pedestrian push button and emergency vehicle detection.
- The simulation can be easily configured and extended to test different traffic light control algorithms.
- The simulation can be run and observed on a hardware description language (HDL) simulator such as ModelSim or Xilinx ISE.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the project in your preferred HDL simulator.
3. Run the simulation and observe the behavior of the traffic light system.
4. Test different traffic light control algorithms by modifying the code and re-running the simulation.

## Note
